# Hello

My name is Ikuma Yamashita.

I work as a public cloud infrastructure engineer, with a focus on AWS.

Outside of work, I continue to enjoy programmingâ€”a passion since before my career began. I actively contribute to open source, and Rust is my favorite language.

In addition to system programming, I also enjoy web development. I've explored various SPA frameworks, but I particularly like Vue.js for its strong support for universal rendering.

In my free time, I enjoy creating digital illustrations.

I am currently based in Tokyo, Japan.
